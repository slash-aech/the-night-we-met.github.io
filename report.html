        Welcome Onboard, Sergeant,<br>
        The time has come.<br>
        One of our finest detectives, Agent Victor, has been missing for two weeks now. There's been no contactâ€”no calls, no faxes; even his home is locked up. As a specially appointed officer on this case, your mission is to uncover Agent Victor's whereabouts within 48 hours. I know this is a challenging task, but thatâ€™s exactly why I selected you. Make sure to review his data thoroughly.<br>
        Agent Victor stored his files on a silver, shiny device. I hope you're familiar with this tech. The team from tech mentioned that his notes and case files are "encrypted." To access them, you'll need to find the passwords he left behind. Luckily, Victor left a note near his workspace:
<span class="detect-note">"If, for any reason, I'm unavailable and the department needs my resources, the password for each diary entry corresponds to the relevant case file. Begin with the evidence in Case File 1, which unlocks Diary Entry 1. Hidden names within each diary entry will then unlock subsequent case files, and so on.Input the password in lowercase, no spaces."</span><br><br>

Our tech team has managed to interpret the structure somewhat:<br>

No input â†’ Case File 1 â†’ Ghost Type 1<br>
Ghost Type 1 â†’ Diary Entry 1 â†’ Hidden Names 1<br>
Hidden Names 1 â†’ Case File 2 â†’ Ghost Type 2<br>
Ghost Type 2 â†’ Diary Entry 2 â†’ Hidden Names 2<br><p>
    and so on....<br>
    I trust youâ€™ve got the hang of it, Sergeant. This mission is now solely in your hands, and I assure you a promotion if you crack it. However, be advised that multiple sergeants are competing to solve this case, so time is of the essence. Youâ€™re my personal choice, so don't let me down.
    <hr>
    Once youâ€™ve gathered all passwords, please email them along with your findings on Victorâ€™s case and how you decoded the case (in more than 200 words) to hossainakmal2045@gmail.com. Youâ€™ll be notified if youâ€™ve succeeded.(Note - You must explain about how you reached to the conclusion of the type of ghost by relating them in the case files and the same for diary entries)<br>
    Here's your ID card: <br>
